NAME
  amorse - encode input into audio adapted International Morse code

SYNOPSIS
  amorse [-d] [-f <frequency>] [-l <length>] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
  amorse reads signals consisting of dots and dashes in the same format printed by
  the sister program morse. amorse encodes said signals into audio ones; square waves
  of max amplitude. This is the standard spacing and length of the signals:

    A dash is equal to three dots.
    The space between the signals forming the same letter is equal to one dot.
    The space between two letters is equal to three dots.
    The space between two words is equal to seven dots.

  As you can see, the dot is the basic unit of length here. See the -l option.

  amorse writes the signals to a file named amorse.pcm with this format:

    Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono

  amorse tries to play the file by invoking the external program aplay:

    aplay -t raw -f U8 -r 8000 -c 1 amorse.pcm

  Playing and keeping the file is optional. See the -d and -q options.

OPTIONS
  -d
    Delete the file after trying to play it.

  -f <frequency>
    The decimal positive integer <frequency> specifies the wave frequency in hertz.
    The default is 400.

  -q
    Be quiet by not trying to play the file.

  -l <length>
    The decimal positive integer <length> specifies the dot length in milliseconds.
    The default is 100.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if opening the file fails;
  4 if an input character is invalid;
  5 if allocating a buffer fails;
  6 if the host environment has no command processor;
  0 otherwise;
