NAME
  build.sh - build some programs and get executables and headers to /usr/local/

SYNOPSIS
  build.sh

DESCRIPTION
  build.sh must be executed from ../src/. It requires permission to write and execute
  /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/include/, which likely requires being the superuser.

  Some programs depend on some of these compilers, interpreters, and libraries:

    cc  (as either Clang or GCC)
    ghc (as the Galsgow Haskell Compiler)

    python3

    libFLAC
    libpng
    zlib

  To install them on Debian or a derivative of it, execute this command line:

    apt install clang ghc python3 libflac8 libflac-dev libpng16-16 libpng-dev \
    zlib1g zlib1g-dev
