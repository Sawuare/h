NAME
  hqz-png - write an HQZ image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  hqz-png [-h <height>] [-l <length>] [-m] [-o <offset>] [-p <ID>] [-q <q-argument>]
          [-w <width>] [-x <x-offset>] [-y <y-offset>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HQZ images, see hqz.txt.

  hqz-png writes an HQZ image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The file
  has a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  p0q1x0y0w512h512.hqz.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    $ hqz-png -p 0 -q 1 -x 0 -y 0 -w 512 -h 512

OPTIONS
  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which specifies
    a square image.

  -m
    Place the origin in the middle of the image by setting the offsets.
    Must not be specified before -h, -l, -o, -w, -x, or -y.

  -o <offset>
    This additional option is equivalent to -x <offset> -y <offset>.

  -p <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 40.

  -q <q-argument>
    The nonnegative integer <q-argument> specifies the painter's q-argument.
    Defaults to 1. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -x <x-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <x-offset> specifies the painter's x-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -y <y-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <y-offset> specifies the painter's y-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
