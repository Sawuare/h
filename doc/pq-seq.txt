SYNOPSIS
  pq-seq

DESCRIPTION
  PQ q-sequences are described at https://husamalhomsi.net/pq-images.

  The sequences are nonnegative integers less than 2 raised to 32, separated by
  spaces, and written to the following files:

    p32q0.pq-seq.txt
    p32q1.pq-seq.txt
    p32q3.pq-seq.txt
    p32q7.pq-seq.txt
    p32q15.pq-seq.txt
    p32q31.pq-seq.txt
    p32q63.pq-seq.txt
    p32q127.pq-seq.txt
    p32q255.pq-seq.txt

  The first four sequences are these sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
  Integer Sequences (OEIS):
