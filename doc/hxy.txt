NAME
  hxy - write an HXY image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  hxy [-h <height>] [-H] [-l <length>] [-s] [-V] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  HXY images are described at https://sawuare.github.io/hxy-images.html.

  hxy writes an HXY image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The
  file has a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file named
  w512h512s.hxy.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    hxy -w 512 -h 512 -s

OPTIONS
  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -H
    Create a horizontal projection as if by moving white pixels up and black
    pixels down.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which
    specifies a square image.

  -s
    Reveal a special shape by flood-filling the top row with a filler color,
    replacing white pixels with black, then replacing filler pixels with white.

  -V
    Create a vertical projection as if by moving white pixels to the left and
    black pixels to the right.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default. The compression is
    lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
