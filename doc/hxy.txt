NAME
  hxy - write an HXY image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  hxy [-f] [-h <height>] [-l <length>] [-v] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  hxy writes an HXY image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The file has
  a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  w512h512f.hxy.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    $ hxy -w 512 -h 512 -f

OPTIONS
  -f

  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which specifies
    a square image.

  -v
    Print libpng and zlib versions then exit.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
