NAME
  hxy - write an HXY image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  hxy [-h <height>] [-l <length>] [-s] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  An HXY image is a mathematical image that is uniquely determined by its dimensions.
  Let the positive integers w and h be the width and height of the image in pixels,
  respectively, and let X and Y be the sets of integers in the intervals [0, w) and
  [0, h), respectively. Let P be the set of products of multiplying every element of
  X by every element of Y. Let the pixels of the image be numbered in row-major order
  by the sequence of integers in the interval [0, wh). If the number of a pixel is in
  P, the pixel is white, otherwise the pixel is black.

  The top row of any HXY image is white. Flood-filling in the top row reveals a
  special shape. See the option -s.

  hxy writes an HXY image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The file has
  a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  w512h512s.hxy.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    $ hxy -w 512 -h 512 -s

OPTIONS
  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which specifies
    a square image.

  -s
    Reveal a special shape by flood-filling in the top row with a filler color, then
    replacing white pixels with black, then replacing filler pixels with white.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
