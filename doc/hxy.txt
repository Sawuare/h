NAME
  hxy - write an HXY image to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  hxy [-c] [-h <height>] [-l <length>] [-r] [-s] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  An HXY image is a mathematical image. Let the positive integers w and h be the
  width and height of the image in pixels, respectively. Let X and Y be the sets
  of integers in the intervals [0, w) and [0, h), respectively. Let P be the set
  of products of multiplying every element of X by every element of Y. Let the
  pixels of the image be numbered in row-major order by the sequence of integers
  in the interval [0, wh). If the number of a pixel is in P, the pixel is white,
  otherwise the pixel is black.

  For example, the HXY image whose width is 4 pixels and height is 3 pixels
  would have its pixels numbered as follows:

    00 01 02 03
    04 05 06 07
    08 09 10 11

  For that image, the variables and sets defined above would be:

    w = 4
    h = 3
    X = {0, 1, 2, 3}
    Y = {0, 1, 2}
    P = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

  So, that image would have its pixels colored as follows:

    White White White White
    White Black White Black
    Black Black Black Black

  The top row of any HXY image is white. Flood-filling the top row reveals a
  special shape. See the option -s.

  hxy writes an HXY image to a 1-bit grayscale, non-interlaced PNG file. The
  file has a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file named
  w512h512s.hxy.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    hxy -w 512 -h 512 -s

OPTIONS
  -c
    Create a "column histogram" as if by moving white pixels up and black pixels
    down.

  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which
    specifies a square image.

  -r
    Create a "row histogram" as if by moving white pixels to the left and black
    pixels to the right.

  -s
    Reveal a special shape by flood-filling the top row with a filler color,
    replacing white pixels with black, then replacing filler pixels with white.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default. The compression is
    lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
