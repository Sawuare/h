NAME
  fb2fb - paint fb images on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  fb2fb [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-i <ID>] [-j <j-value>] [-l]
        [-s <step>]

DESCRIPTION
  fb images are algorithmic patterns painted by painters. There are 33 painters with
  each having a serial identifier (ID) and parameters: j-value, color, horizontal
  resolution, and vertical resolution. Different painters paint different patterns.
  Varying the j-value of a painter varies its pattern.

  fb2fb requires permission to read and write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0,
  which likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  fb2fb should be executed in the Linux console (i.e. TERM=linux).

  These keys can be used to navigate and control fb2fb during execution:

    { decrements the ID;
    } increments the ID;
    [ decrements the j-value;
    ] increments the j-value;
    i sets the ID to the decimal nonnegative integer entered next;
    j sets the j-value to the decimal positive integer entered next;
    l toggles the status line;
    e exits;

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb.
    The default is ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    The default is w.

  -i <ID>
    The decimal nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID and must be less
    than 33.
    The default is 0.

  -j <j-value>
    The decimal positive integer <j-value> specifies the painter's j-value.
    The default is 1.

  -l
    Enable the status line.

  -s <step>
    The decimal nonnegative integer <step> specifies the j-value decrement/increment.
    The default is 1.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if opening /dev/fb0 failed;
  3 if mapping /dev/fb0 failed;
  4 if the ID or j-value are invalid;
  0 otherwise;

BUGS
  The source fb.h is unportable; it makes assumptions about the framebuffer. For easy
  adjustment, the assumptions are marked as UNPORTABLE.
