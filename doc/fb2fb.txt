NAME
  fb2fb - paint fb images on the framebuffer

SYNOPSIS
  fb2fb [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-i <id>] [-l] [-s <step>] [-z <z>]

DESCRIPTION
  fb2fb requires permission to read and write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0.
  That might require being the superuser or being in the video group.

  fb2fb must be executed in the Linux console (i.e. TERM=linux).

  The following keys can be used to navigate and control fb2fb during execution.

    { decrements ID;
    } increments ID;
    [ decrements Z;
    ] increments Z;
    i sets ID to the decimal nonnegative integer entered next;
    z sets Z to the decimal positive integer entered next;
    l toggles the status line;
    e exits;

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb.
    The default is ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    The default is w.

  -i <id>
    The decimal nonnegative integer <id> specifies the painter's ID and must be less
    than 33.
    The default is 0.

  -l
    Turn on the status line.

  -s <step>
    The decimal nonnegative integer <step> specifies the Z decrement/increment step.
    The default is 1.

  -z <z>
    The decimal positive integer <z> specifies the painter's Z.
    The default is 1.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if opening /dev/fb0 failed;
  3 if mapping /dev/fb0 failed;
  4 if ID or Z is invalid;
  0 otherwise;
