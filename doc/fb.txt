NAME
  fb.h - code for fb images and macros for the framebuffer

SYNOPSIS
  #include "fb.h"

DESCRIPTION
  fb images are painted by painters, which are functions of these parameters: a
  canvas, its width and height, a color, and a j-value. Painters produce patterns
  using arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operators on the canvas coordinates, the
  color, and the j-value. Different painters produce different patterns, while
  different j-values vary the patterns. Every painter is identified by a serial ID:
  "pN" and "painter N" denote a painter whose ID is N.

  There are 50 painters, 0 through 49, divided into 10 classes, 0 through 9. Painters
  in classes 2, 4, 6, and 8 divide by the j-value, so j-value 0 is invalid for them.

  Notes:

    1. p0 does not use the j-value.
    2. p1, p2, p3, and p4 do nothing; they are reserved for future implementation.
