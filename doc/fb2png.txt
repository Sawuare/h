NAME
  fb2png - write fb images in the PNG format

SYNOPSIS
  fb2png [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-i <ID>] [-j <j>] [-v] [-x <x-px>]
         [-y <y-px>]

DESCRIPTION
  fb images are algorithmic patterns painted by painters. There are 33 painters with
  each having a serial identifier (ID) and parameters: j value, color, horizontal
  resolution, and vertical resolution. Different painters paint different patterns.
  Varying the j value of a painter varies its pattern.

  fb2png writes a fb image to a 24-bit RGB, non-interlaced PNG file. The file has a
  name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  i0j1x256y256#ffffff.fb.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to this:

    fb2png -i 0 -j 1 -x 256 -y 256 -# ffffff

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb.
    The default is ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    The default is w.

  -i <ID>
    The decimal nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID and must be less
    than 33.
    The default is 0.

  -j <j>
    The decimal positive integer <j> specifies the painter's j.
    The default is 1.

  -v
    Print libpng and zlib versions then exit.

  -x <x-px>
    The decimal positive integer <x-px> specifies the image's horizontal resolution
    in pixels.
    The default is 256.

  -y <y-px>
    The decimal positive integer <y-px> specifies the image's vertical resolution in
    pixels.
    The default is 256.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating the libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating a buffer fails;
  0 otherwise;
