NAME
  fb2png - write a fb image in the PNG format

SYNOPSIS
  fb2png [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-h <height>] [-i <ID>]
         [-j <j-value>] [-v] [-w <width>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of fb images, see the beginning of fb.txt.

  fb2png writes a fb image to a 24-bit RGB, non-interlaced PNG file. The file has a
  name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  i0j0w512h512#ffffff.fb.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to this:

    fb2png -i 0 -j 0 -w 512 -h 512 -# ffffff

  Image areas greater than a gibipixel (i.e. 1073741824 pixels) are invalid.

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb. Leading 0s may be omitted.
    Defaults to ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    Defaults to w.

  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512.

  -i <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID and must be less than 40.
    Defaults to 0.

  -j <j-value>
    The nonnegative integer <j-value> specifies the painter's j-value.
    Defaults to 0.

  -v
    Print libpng and zlib versions then exit.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating the libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating a buffer fails;
  0 otherwise;
