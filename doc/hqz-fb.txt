NAME
  hqz-fb - paint HQZ images on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  hqz-fb [-l] [-o <offset>] [-p <ID>] [-q <Q-value>] [-s <step>] [-x <X-offset>]
         [-y <Y-offset>]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HQZ images, see the beginning of hqz.txt.

  hqz-fb requires permission to read and write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0,
  which likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  hqz-fb should be executed in the Linux terminal (i.e. TERM=linux).

  These keys can be used to navigate and control hqz-fb during execution:

    1 decrements the ID;
    2 increments the ID;
    3 decrements the Q-value;
    4 increments the Q-value;
    5 decrements the X-offset;
    6 increments the X-offset;
    7 decrements the Y-offset;
    8 increments the Y-offset;
    p sets the ID to the argument entered next (like -p and its argument);
    q sets the Q-value to the argument entered next (like -q and its argument);
    x sets the X-offset to the argument entered next (like -x and its argument);
    y sets the Y-offset to the argument entered next (like -y and its argument);
    l toggles the status line;
    m places the origin in the middle of the image by setting the offsets;
    e exits;

  The status line shows the ID, Q-value, X-offset, and Y-offset. If the ID or Q-value
  are undefined, the status line is automatically printed with " !" appended.

OPTIONS
  -l
    Disable the status line.

  -o <offset>
    This additional option is equivalent to -x <offset> -y <offset>.

  -p <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 40.

  -q <Q-value>
    The nonnegative integer <Q-value> specifies the painter's Q-value.
    Defaults to 1. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -s <step>
    The nonnegative integer <step> specifies the offsets' decrement/increment.
    Defaults to 32. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -x <X-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <X-offset> specifies the painter's X-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -y <Y-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <Y-offset> specifies the painter's Y-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if opening the framebuffer device fails;
  3 if getting framebuffer attributes fails;
  4 if mapping the framebuffer device fails;
  5 if allocating memory fails;
  6 if getting terminal attributes fails;
  7 if setting terminal attributes fails;
  0 otherwise;

BUGS
  hqz-fb requires a framebuffer whose color format is 32-bit ARGB.
