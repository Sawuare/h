NAME
  eca.py - paint elementary cellular automata on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  eca.py

DESCRIPTION
  eca.py requires permission to write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0, which
  likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  eca.py should be executed in the Linux console (i.e. TERM=linux).

BUGS
  The source eca.py is unportable; it makes assumptions about the framebuffer. For
  easy adjustment, the assumptions are marked as UNPORTABLE.
