NAME
  eca.py - paint elementary cellular automata on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  eca.py

DESCRIPTION
  Given a rule and a seed as nonnegative integers, eca.py paints an elementary
  cellular automaton on the screen. Horizontal generations of cells are painted
  vertically from top to bottom, with dead cells in black and alive cells in white.
  The seed is used to randomize the 1st generation. Seed 0 is special; it does not
  randomize the 1st generation but instead places only 1 alive cell in its middle.

  eca.py requires permission to write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0, which
  likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  eca.py should be executed in the Linux console (i.e. TERM=linux).

BUGS
  The source eca.py is unportable; it makes assumptions about the framebuffer. For
  easy adjustment, the assumptions are marked as UNPORTABLE.
