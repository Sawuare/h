NAME
  eca - paint elementary cellular automata on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  eca

DESCRIPTION
  Given a rule and a seed as nonnegative integers, eca paints an elementary cellular
  automaton on the screen. Horizontal generations of cells are painted vertically
  from top to bottom, with dead cells in black and alive cells in white. The seed is
  used to randomize the 1st generation. Seed 0 is special; it does not randomize the
  1st generation but instead places only 1 alive cell in its middle.

  eca requires permission to write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0, which
  likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  eca should be executed in the Linux terminal (i.e. TERM=linux).

BUGS
  The source code in eca.py is unportable; it makes assumptions about the
  framebuffer. For easy adjustment, the assumptions are marked "UNPORTABLE".
