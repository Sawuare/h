DESCRIPTION
  An HPQ image is a mathematical image. A function called a painter and denoted
  p#(q, x, y) is applied to every pixel in the image. The #, q, x, y, and value
  of the painter are nonnegative integers. The # is the serial identifier (ID)
  of the painter. The q is called the q-argument. The x and y are the horizontal
  and vertical coordinates of a pixel, respectively. If p#(q, x, y) = 0, the
  pixel is white, otherwise the pixel is black.

  p#(q, x, y) = p#(q, y, x) for any #, q, x, and y, so all HPQ images are
  symmetric around the line x = y.

  There are 40 defined painters, 0 through 39, divided into 8 classes, 0 through
  7. Painters in classes 1, 3, 5, and 7 divide by the q-argument, so q-argument
  0 is undefined for them. Painters in different classes use different formulas,
  whereas painters in the same class differ by the main operation they use.
  Painters cycle through the following main operations in order:

    0. AND: Bitwise AND
    1.  OR: Bitwise inclusive OR
    2. XOR: Bitwise exclusive OR
    3. ADD: Addition
    4. MUL: Multiplication

  Since there are 5 main operations, an ID modulo 5 gives the main operation of
  its painter as an index in the list above, whereas an ID divided by 5 gives
  the class of its painter.
