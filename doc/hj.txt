NAME
  hj.h - code for HJ images

SYNOPSIS
  #include "hj.h"

DESCRIPTION
  HJ images are painted by painters, which are functions of these parameters: a
  canvas, its width and height, a color, and a J-value. Painters produce patterns
  using arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operators on the canvas coordinates, the
  color, and the J-value. Different painters produce different patterns, while
  different J-values vary the patterns. Every painter is identified by a serial ID:
  "PN" and "painter N" denote a painter whose ID is N.

  There are 50 painters, 0 through 49, divided into 10 classes, 0 through 9. Painters
  in classes 2, 4, 6, and 8 divide by the J-value, so J-value 0 is invalid for them.

  Notes:

    1. P0 does not use the J-value.
    2. P1, P2, P3, and P4 do nothing; they are reserved for future implementation.
