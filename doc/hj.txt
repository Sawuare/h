NAME
  hj.h - code for HJ images

SYNOPSIS
  #include "hj.h"

  _Bool hj_defined(void);

  void hj_painter0(void);
  ...
  void hj_painter39(void);

  void (*hj_painters[40])(void);

DESCRIPTION
  HJ images are painted by painters, which are functions of these parameters: a
  canvas, its width and height, horizontal and vertical offsets ("X-offset" and
  "Y-offset"), and a J-value. Painters generate patterns using arithmetic and bitwise
  operators on the canvas coordinates and the J-value. Different painters generate
  different patterns, whereas different J-values vary the patterns. Every painter is
  identified by a serial ID: "painter #" denotes the painter whose ID is #.

  In theory, the ID, J-value, and offsets are nonnegative integers, whereas the width
  and height are positive integers. In practice, they are unsigned 32-bit integers.

  There are 40 defined painters, 0 through 39, divided into 8 classes, 0 through 7.
  Painters in classes 1, 3, 5, and 7 divide by the J-value, so J-value 0 is undefined
  for them. Painters in different classes use different formulas, whereas painters in
  the same class differ by the main operation they use. Painters cycle through the
  following main operations in order:

    0. AND: Bitwise AND
    1.  OR: Bitwise inclusive OR
    2. XOR: Bitwise exclusive OR
    3. ADD: Addition
    4. MUL: Multiplication

  Since there are 5 main operations, an ID modulo 5 gives the main operation of its
  painter as an index in the list above, whereas an ID divided by 5 gives the class
  of its painter.
