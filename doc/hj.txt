DESCRIPTION
  HJ images are painted by painters, which are functions of these parameters: a
  canvas, its width and height, horizontal and vertical offsets ("X-offset" and
  "Y-offset"), a color, and a J-value. Painters produce patterns using arithmetic,
  bitwise, and conditional operators on the canvas coordinates, the color, and the
  J-value. Different painters produce different patterns, whereas different J-values
  vary the patterns. Every painter is identified by a serial ID: "painter #" denotes
  the painter whose ID is #.

  The ID, J-value, color, and offsets are nonnegative integers, whereas the width and
  height are positive integers.

  There are 45 defined painters, 0 through 44, divided into 9 classes, 0 through 8.
  Painters in classes 1, 3, 5, and 7 divide by the J-value, so J-value 0 is undefined
  for them.
