  hpq-seq - write some HPQ q-sequences

SYNOPSIS
  hpq-seq

DESCRIPTION
  HPQ q-sequences are described at https://sawuare.net/hpq-images.

  The sequences are nonnegative integers less than 2 raised to 32, separated by
  spaces, and written to the following files:

    p32q0.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q1.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q3.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q7.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q15.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q31.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q63.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q127.hpq-seq.txt
    p32q255.hpq-seq.txt

  The first four sequences are these sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
  Integer Sequences (OEIS):
