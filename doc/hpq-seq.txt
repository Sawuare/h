NAME
  hpq-seq - write some HPQ q-sequences

SYNOPSIS
  hpq-seq

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HPQ q-arguments, see hpq.txt.

  The sequences are nonnegative integers less than 2 raised to 32, separated by
  spaces, and written to these files:

    p22a0.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a1.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a2.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a3.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a4.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a5.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a6.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a7.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a8.hpq-seq.txt
    p22a9.hpq-seq.txt

  Where "p#" denotes a sequence for the HPQ painter whose ID is #.

  The first four sequences are these sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
  Integer Sequences (OEIS):
