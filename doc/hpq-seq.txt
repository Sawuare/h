NAME
  hpq-seq - write some HPQ q-sequences

SYNOPSIS
  hpq-seq

DESCRIPTION
  HPQ q-sequences are described at https://sawuare.github.io/hpq-images.

  The sequences are nonnegative integers less than 2 raised to 32, separated by
  spaces, and written to these files:

    p22q0.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q1.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q3.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q7.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q15.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q31.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q63.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q127.hpq-seq.txt
    p22q255.hpq-seq.txt

  Where "p#" denotes a sequence for the HPQ painter whose ID is #.

  The first four sequences are these sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
  Integer Sequences (OEIS):
