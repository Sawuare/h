NAME
  hacc - print random characters in random colors and positions until interrupted

SYNOPSIS
  hacc [<pause>]

DESCRIPTION
  The characters are the graphic ASCII characters. The colors are black, red, green,
  yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.

  If given, the integer <pause>, which must be in the range [0, 999], specifies in
  milliseconds the pause between characters, which is otherwise 125 milliseconds.

  If interrupted, such as with Ctrl+C (^C), hacc resets the terminal to its initial
  state then exits.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if the argument is invalid;
  2 if getting the terminal window size fails;
  0 otherwise;
