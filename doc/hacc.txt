NAME
  hacc - print random characters in random colors and positions until interrupted

SYNOPSIS
  hacc [<zzz>]

DESCRIPTION
  hacc prints up to 128 different characters in up to 256 different shades of green
  over the entire terminal window.

  If given, the decimal integer <zzz>, which must be in the range [0, 999999999],
  specifies in nanoseconds the pause duration between characters, which is otherwise
  125000000 nanoseconds.

  If interrupted, such as with Ctrl+C (^C), hacc resets the terminal to its initial
  state then exits.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if the argument is invalid;
  2 if getting the terminal window size fails;
  0 otherwise;
