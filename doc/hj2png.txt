NAME
  hj2png - write an HJ image in the PNG format

SYNOPSIS
  hj2png [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-h <height>] [-i <ID>]
         [-j <J-value>] [-l <length>] [-o <offset>] [-v] [-w <width>] [-x <X-offset>]
         [-y <Y-offset>] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HJ images, see the beginning of hj.txt.

  hj2png writes an HJ image to a 24-bit RGB, non-interlaced PNG file. The file has a
  name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file with the name
  i0j1x0y0w512h512#ffffff.hj.png can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    $ hj2png -i 0 -j 1 -x 0 -y 0 -w 512 -h 512 -# ffffff

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb. Leading 0s may be omitted.
    Defaults to ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    Defaults to w.

  -h <height>
    The positive integer <height> specifies the image's height in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 1048576 (i.e. one mebipixel).

  -i <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 45.

  -j <J-value>
    The nonnegative integer <J-value> specifies the painter's J-value.
    Defaults to 1. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -l <length>
    This additional option is equivalent to -w <length> -h <length>, which specifies
    a square image.

  -o <offset>
    This additional option is equivalent to -x <offset> -y <offset>.

  -v
    Print libpng and zlib versions then exit.

  -w <width>
    The positive integer <width> specifies the image's width in pixels.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 1048576 (i.e. one mebipixel).

  -x <X-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <X-offset> specifies the painter's X-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -y <Y-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <Y-offset> specifies the painter's Y-offset.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
