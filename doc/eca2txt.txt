NAME
  eca2txt - print an elementary cellular automaton

SYNOPSIS
  eca2txt [-a <alive>] [-c <cells>] [-d <dead>] [-g <generations>] [-r <rule>]
          [-s <seed>] [-t]

OPTIONS
  -a <alive>
    The string of characters <alive> specifies what to print for alive cells.
    Defaults to the Unicode character FULL BLOCK.

  -c <cells>
    The positive integer <cells> specifies the number of cells in a generation.
    Defaults to the number of columns in the terminal window.

  -d <dead>
    The string of characters <dead> specifies what to print for dead cells.
    Defaults to the Unicode character LIGHT SHADE.

  -g <generations>
    The positive integer <generations> specifies the number of generations.
    Defaults to the number of rows in the terminal window minus 1.

  -r <rule>
    The nonnegative integer <rule> specifies the rule.
    Defaults to 60. Must be less than 256.

  -s <seed>
    The nonnegative integer <seed> specifies the seed used to randomize the 1st
    generation. Seed 0 is special; it does not randomize the 1st generation but
    instead places only 1 alive cell in its middle.
    Defaults to 0.

  -t
    Print the rule as a truth table then exit.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if getting the terminal window size fails;
  4 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
