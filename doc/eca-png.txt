NAME
  eca-png - write an elementary cellular automaton to a PNG file

SYNOPSIS
  eca-png [-c <cells>] [-g <generations>] [-r <rule>] [-s <seed>] [-z]

OPTIONS
  -c <cells>
    The positive integer <cells> specifies the number of cells in a generation.
    Defaults to 512. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -g <generations>
    The positive integer <generations> specifies the number of generations.
    Defaults to 256. Must be less than or equal to 32768.

  -r <rule>
    The nonnegative integer <rule> specifies the rule.
    Defaults to 18. Must be less than 256.

  -s <seed>
    The nonnegative integer <seed> specifies the seed used to randomize the 1st
    generation. Seed 0 is special; it does not randomize the 1st generation but
    instead places only 1 alive cell in its middle.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -z
    Use the best compression level instead of the default.
    The compression is lossless, so expect the same image in more time and less size.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if creating libpng structs fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if another libpng error occurs;
  6 if allocating memory fails;
  0 otherwise;
