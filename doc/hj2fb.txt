NAME
  hj2fb - paint HJ images on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  hj2fb [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-i <ID>] [-j <J-value>] [-l]
        [-o <offset>] [-s <step>] [-x <X-offset>] [-y <Y-offset>]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HJ images, see the beginning of hj.txt.

  hj2fb requires permission to read and write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0,
  which likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  hj2fb should be executed in the Linux terminal (i.e. TERM=linux).

  These keys can be used to navigate and control hj2fb during execution:

    1 decrements the ID;
    2 increments the ID;
    3 decrements the J-value;
    4 increments the J-value;
    5 decrements the X-offset;
    6 increments the X-offset;
    7 decrements the Y-offset;
    8 increments the Y-offset;
    # sets the color to the argument entered next (like -# and its argument);
    i sets the ID to the argument entered next (like -i and its argument);
    j sets the J-value to the argument entered next (like -j and its argument);
    x sets the X-offset to the argument entered next (like -x and its argument);
    y sets the Y-offset to the argument entered next (like -y and its argument);
    l toggles the status line;
    e exits;

  The status line shows the ID, J-value, X-offset, Y-offset, and color. If the ID or
  J-value are undefined, the status line is automatically printed with an exclamation
  mark (!) as the last character.

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb. Leading 0s may be omitted.
    Defaults to ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    Defaults to w.

  -i <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID and must be less than 45.
    Defaults to 0.

  -j <J-value>
    The nonnegative integer <J-value> specifies the painter's J-value.
    Defaults to 1.

  -l
    Enable the status line.

  -o <offset>
    This additional option is equivalent to -x <offset> -y <offset>.

  -s <step>
    The nonnegative integer <step> specifies the offsets' decrement/increment.
    Defaults to 32.

  -x <X-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <X-offset> specifies the painter's X-offset.
    Defaults to 0.

  -y <Y-offset>
    The nonnegative integer <Y-offset> specifies the painter's Y-offset.
    Defaults to 0.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if opening /dev/fb0 failed;
  4 if mapping /dev/fb0 failed;
  5 if getting terminal attributes fails;
  6 if setting terminal attributes fails;
  0 otherwise;

BUGS
  hj2fb requires a framebuffer whose color format is 32-bit ARGB.

  The source code in hj2fb.c is unportable; it makes assumptions about the
  framebuffer. For easy adjustment, the assumptions are marked "UNPORTABLE".
