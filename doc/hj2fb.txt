NAME
  hj2fb - paint HJ images on the Linux framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
  hj2fb [-# <color-rrggbb>] [-c <color-letter>] [-i <ID>] [-j <J-value>] [-l]
        [-s <step>]

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HJ images, see the beginning of hj.txt.

  hj2fb requires permission to read and write the Linux framebuffer device /dev/fb0,
  which likely requires being the superuser or being in the video group.

  hj2fb should be executed in the Linux terminal (i.e. TERM=linux).

  These keys can be used to navigate and control hj2fb during execution:

    { decrements the ID;
    } increments the ID;
    [ decrements the J-value;
    ] increments the J-value;
    i sets the ID to the nonnegative integer entered next;
    j sets the J-value to the nonnegative integer entered next;
    l toggles the status line;
    e exits;

  The status line shows the ID and J-value. If the ID is not available or the J-value
  is not applicable, a warning line is automatically printed.

OPTIONS
  -# <color-rrggbb>
    The hexadecimal nonnegative integer <color-rrggbb> specifies the painting color
    in the form rrggbb. Leading 0s may be omitted.
    Defaults to ffffff.

  -c <color-letter>
    The letter <color-letter> specifies the painting color and should be one of
    (r|g|b|c|m|y|w) for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, or white.
    Defaults to w.

  -i <ID>
    The nonnegative integer <ID> specifies the painter's ID and must be less than 50.
    Defaults to 0.

  -j <J-value>
    The nonnegative integer <J-value> specifies the painter's J-value.
    Defaults to 0.

  -l
    Enable the status line.

  -s <step>
    The nonnegative integer <step> specifies the J-value decrement/increment.
    Defaults to 1.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if opening /dev/fb0 failed;
  4 if mapping /dev/fb0 failed;
  0 otherwise;

BUGS
  The source code in hj.h and hj2fb.c is unportable; it makes assumptions about the
  framebuffer. For easy adjustment, the assumptions are marked "UNPORTABLE".
