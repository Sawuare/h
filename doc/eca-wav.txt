NAME
  eca-wav - write an audio elementary cellular automaton to a WAVE file

SYNOPSIS
  eca-wav [-c <cells>] [-g <generations>] [-r <rule>] [-s <seed>]

DESCRIPTION
  eca-wav generates generations of cells that evolve according to an elementary
  cellular automata rule. The generations are concatenated and converted to an
  audio stream. Dead cells become silence, and alive cells alternate up and down
  between the maximum amplitudes. eca-wav writes the stream to a WAVE file. The
  file has 1 channel, unsigned 8-bit samples, and 44100 samples per second.

  Evolutions start from either a fixed state or a random state that is seeded
  manually. The former tend to sound tonal, whereas the latter tend to sound
  atonal. See the option -s.

  The file has a name that encodes how it was produced. For example, a file
  named r18s0c256g128.eca.wav can be reproduced by an invocation equivalent to

    eca-wav -r 18 -s 0 -c 256 -g 128

OPTIONS
  -c <cells>
    The positive integer <cells> specifies the number of cells in a generation.
    Defaults to 256. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -g <generations>
    The positive integer <generations> specifies the number of generations.
    Defaults to 128. Must be less than 4294967296.

  -r <rule>
    The nonnegative integer <rule> specifies the rule.
    Defaults to 18. Must be less than 256.

  -s <seed>
    The nonnegative integer <seed> specifies the seed used to randomize the 1st
    generation. Seed 0 is special; it does not randomize the 1st generation but
    instead places only 1 alive cell in its middle.
    Defaults to 0. Must be less than 4294967296.

EXIT STATUS
  1 if an option is invalid;
  2 if an option argument is invalid;
  3 if allocating memory fails;
  4 if opening the file fails;
  5 if writing the file or closing it fails;
  0 otherwise;
