NAME
  hqz-seq - write some HQZ q-sequences

SYNOPSIS
  hqz-seq

DESCRIPTION
  For a description of HQZ q-arguments, see hqz.txt.

  The sequences are nonnegative integers less than 2 raised to 32, separated by
  spaces, and written to these files:

    p22a0.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a1.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a2.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a3.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a4.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a5.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a6.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a7.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a8.hqz-seq.txt
    p22a9.hqz-seq.txt

  Where "p#" denotes a sequence for the HQZ painter whose ID is #.

  The first four sequences are these sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
  Integer Sequences (OEIS):
