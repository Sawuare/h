Here is my terminal software, including programs and libraries for terminal control,
audio, graphics, patterns, physics, mathematics, utility, and fun. Some programs use
features of POSIX or Linux, so I recommend GNU/Linux for using them.

The programs and libraries in here are:

  ctime - print the local time in the form Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy
  eca.h - code for elementary cellular automata
  eca2png - write an elementary cellular automaton to a PNG file
  eca2txt - print an elementary cellular automaton
  eca2wav - write an audio elementary cellular automaton to a WAVE file
  ecma48.h - control functions for coded character sets in 7-bit codes
  getlocale - print the current locale
  hacc - print random characters in random colors and positions until interrupted
  hj.h - code for HJ images
  hj2fb - paint HJ images on the Linux framebuffer device
  hj2png - write an HJ image to a PNG file
  hjjs - write some HJ J-sequences
  limits - print every standard limit in <limits.h>
  midi - print a table of MIDI note number, notation, and frequency
  morse - encode arguments into printable adapted International Morse code
  pp - print a penis icon incrementally
  printable - print a table of printable ASCII characters and their codes
  projectile - analyze dragless projectile motion on Earth
  sumber - print a statistical summary of input numbers
  tcem.h - text cursor enable mode
  wafer.h - code for writing 8-bit PCM WAVE files

  doc/
    Documentation of the programs and headers.

  out/
    Output of some of the programs.

  src/
