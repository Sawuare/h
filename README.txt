Misk is a collection of miscellaneous terminal software. It includes programs
and libraries for terminal control, audio, graphics, mathematics, utility, and
fun. Some programs use features of POSIX or Linux, so GNU/Linux is recommended
for using them.

  ctime - print the local time in the form Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy
  eca-png - write an elementary cellular automaton to a PNG file
  eca-txt - print an elementary cellular automaton
  eca-wav - write an audio elementary cellular automaton to a WAVE file
  eca.h - code for elementary cellular automata
  ecma48.h - control functions for coded character sets in 7-bit codes
  getlocale - print the current locale
  hpq-fb - display HPQ images on the Linux framebuffer device
