Here is my terminal software, including headers for terminal control and programs
about audio, graphics, patterns, physics, mathematics, utility, and fun. Some
programs use features of POSIX or Linux, so I recommend GNU/Linux for using them.

The directories and files in here are:

  add/
    Additional scripts which must be executed from this directory.

    *.sh -> POSIX shell scripts

  doc/
    Documentation of the programs and headers.

  out/
    Output of some of the programs.

  src/
    Source code in a few programming languages.

    *.c  -> C source files
    *.h  -> C headers
    *.py -> Python scripts

  .bashrc
    My Bash configuration file.

  .nanorc
    My nano configuration file.

  LICENSE.txt
    The MIT License under which everything else is licensed.

  README.txt
    This file.

For a summary of every program and header, execute

  $ cd add/ && ./summarize.sh

To get started, see add/build.sh.
