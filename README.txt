Misk is a collection of miscellaneous terminal software. It includes programs
and libraries for terminal control, audio, graphics, mathematics, utility, and
fun. Some programs use features of POSIX or Linux, so GNU/Linux is recommended
for using them.

The programs and libraries in here are:

  ctime     - print the local time in the form Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy
  eca-png   - write an elementary cellular automaton to a PNG file
  eca-txt   - print an elementary cellular automaton
  eca-wav   - write an elementary cellular automaton as audio to a WAVE file
  eca.h     - library for elementary cellular automata
  ecma-48.h - control functions for coded character sets in 7-bit codes
  getlocale - print the current locale
  limits    - print every standard limit in <limits.h>
  midi      - print a table of MIDI note number, notation, and frequency
  morse     - print arguments as Morse code
  pq-fb     - display PQ images on the Linux framebuffer device
  pq-png    - write a PQ image to a PNG file
  pq-seq    - write some PQ q-sequences
  pq.h      - library for PQ images
  printable - print a table of printable ASCII characters and their codes
  rainbow   - print a sine-shaped 6-color rainbow
  sumber    - print a statistical summary of input numbers
  tcem.h    - text cursor enable mode
  ttt       - tic-tac-toe, aka noughts-and-crosses
  wafer.h   - library for writing 8-bit PCM WAVE files
  xy-png    - write an XY image to a PNG file
