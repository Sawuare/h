Here is my terminal software, including programs and libraries for terminal
control, audio, graphics, physics, mathematics, utility, and fun. Some programs
use features of POSIX or Linux, so I recommend GNU/Linux for using them.

The programs and libraries in here are:

  ctime - print the local time in the form Www Mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy
  eca-png - write an elementary cellular automaton to a PNG file
  eca-txt - print an elementary cellular automaton
  eca-wav - write an audio elementary cellular automaton to a WAVE file
  eca.h - code for elementary cellular automata
  ecma48.h - control functions for coded character sets in 7-bit codes
  getlocale - print the current locale
  hqz-fb - display HQZ images on the Linux framebuffer device
  hqz-png - write an HQZ image to a PNG file
  hqz-seq - write some HQZ q-sequences
  hqz.h - code for HQZ images
  hxy - write an HXY image to a PNG file
  limits - print every standard limit in <limits.h>
  midi - print a table of MIDI note number, notation, and frequency
  morse - encode arguments into printable adapted International Morse code
  pp - print a penis icon incrementally
  printable - print a table of printable ASCII characters and their codes
  projectile - analyze dragless projectile motion on Earth
  rainbow - print a sine-shaped 6-color rainbow
  sumber - print a statistical summary of input numbers
  tcem.h - text cursor enable mode
  ttt - tic-tac-toe, aka noughts-and-crosses
  wafer.h - code for writing 8-bit PCM WAVE files

  doc/
    Documentation of the programs and headers.

  out/
    Output of some of the programs.

  src/
